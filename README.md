# Spheroid-Characterisation-and-Cell-Counting-Software

This MATLAB-based software is designed for the advanced characterisation of spheroids through medical image processing techniques. It offers a robust solution for extracting both quantitative and qualitative metrics from spheroid mould images, facilitating the analysis of cell viability and quality. Additionally, the software includes an automated cell counting feature for agarose moulds, significantly enhancing research efficiency by eliminating the need for time-consuming manual counting processes.

## Key Features
* Spheroid Characterisation: Utilises cutting-edge image processing techniques to analyse spheroid moulds.
* Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics: Extracts valuable data from spheroid images for comprehensive analysis.
* Automated Cell Counting: Implements an algorithm to count cells in agarose moulds automatically.
* User-Friendly GUI: Features an intuitive Graphical User Interface, making it accessible to users without programming experience.
